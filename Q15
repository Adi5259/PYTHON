# Write a program to calculate compound intrest

p = int(input("Principal amount: "))
r = float(input("Rate (% per annum): "))
t = float(input("Duration (in years): "))
n = int(input("Number of times interest is compounded per year: "))

# Convert annual rate to decimal
r = r / 100

# Compound interest formula
A = p * ((1 + r/n) ** (n * t))
interest = A - p

print(f"Compound Interest = {interest:.2f}") # .2f is used to display the output upto 2 decimal places
print(f"Total Amount = {A:.2f}")
